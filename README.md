# GitOps with ArgoCD Showcase

This repository is used to demo the GitOps concept and best practices with ArgoCD.

It uses the concept of "app of apps" to manage apps automatically across multiple clusters.

A multi-cluster service mesh is also included, so is a multi-cluster canary release, to showcase the power of GitOps + service mesh + canary deployment strategy.
